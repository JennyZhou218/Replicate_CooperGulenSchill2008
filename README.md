# Replicate_CooperGulenSchill2008
This project replicate and extend the findings of "Asset Growth and the Cross-Section of Stock Returns" by Cooper, Gulen, and Schill (2008).   
A simple measure of asset growth can generate a robust 11% annual return. After adjusting for risks, the asset growth portfolio still generate 6.2% annual return.   
My code extend their original finding of CGS and find that the anomoly dampens after its discovery in 2004, and further examines the intra-industry asset growth effect.      
     
You need a wrds account to access the database used in this program.  
There are 8 output tables in this project. Table 1 to table 4 replicates CGS 2008. Table 5 to table 8 show the intra-industry results.    
The detailed description of the tables can be find in the PDF file.
